# Live-chat ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to **Live-chat** â€“  unfinished, but kind of fun place to chat with random humans from the internet.

Whether you want to share memes, test if your keyboard still works, or just yell into the void â€” this is your spot.

## ðŸŒŸ What works

- **Chat with people** â€“ Talk to anyone who's online. If there's no one... well, talk to yourself.
- **Messages show up in real-time** â€“ Most of the time. Hopefully.
- **JSON data storage** â€“ All messages are saved in `.json` files.
- **No login system** â€“ Just load the site and chat with people instantly!
- **Vibes** â€“ Friendly-ish and full of weird jokes.

## ðŸ“¦ Example data (because yes, it uses JSON)

The JSON files include sample data so you can see how everythingâ€™s saved.
